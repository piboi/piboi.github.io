this is just like "huh". 11 down, 1 to go.

I feel like this year has been just weird in a lot of ways. I'm sure every person has found it weird/interesting in their own ways. December is probably my most and least favorite month because 1) winter break is awesome and 2) the days are just too short and sunsets and sunrises are nonexistent. I could prob not be able to understand what it would feel like to spend winter up north. Going outside and running is just suboptimal. I went out to run yesterday and yeah PE has made me less fit than I was before. This is probably because all we do is run a lap and then like play kickball.

School has been ok so far. We started last week with online school so it was kinda a nice easy way to start of the 3 week homework grind before winter break. Took a history test last week which let's just say I overestimated how well I did? I think the teacher graded it wrong bc like there were 38 questions but in each question there was like 2-3 blanks so i think he just counted each prob missed over 38 so rip me ig. I found online school to be like boring, but I had more free time then because there are like 5 min intervals that you can do anything in now rather than having to just walk. But in person is better (except for having to deal with fifths that all don't cover their noses when wearing masks smh). It's just better to be able to talk with friends w/o using text based stuff. I've also found that every successive year in school, i go to bed like 30 mins later than the last year and wake up like 5 mins earlier. I got 2 shots last Friday and was pretty tired over the weekend.

Got big plans from now to January 15th so let's hope that I'll be able to finish them. I have like tons and tons of boards on trello and like none of them are finished so yeah. I've been working on a collection of combo probs which are all either modified or original since the start of thanksgiving and hopefully I'll get to 100+ problems by the end of January next year? Would need some help though. Was originally for mods qotd which is currently ongoing :yaw:

I've been fsmed on cncm for like the past 2 months and this newfound productivity is just epic. The problem is that I have now found other outlets to spam in but at least I do more productive things now. Cutting down on non-academic screen time has like been nice. The thing about yt is that you just keep on scrolling through videos until you feel satisfied with it and go on to do other things. But the problem is that you never actually find anything funny/satisfying enough to stop until you realize an hour has already gone by.

Also gonna be writing an oly for my server for december so yea, still not much progress on that tho rippp

Sorry for everyone who had to read like 69 grammatical errors though, happy hw grinding b4 break every1, hopefully y'all will find time to do other stuff

(Also i just noticed this was the 50th post so yeah inch resting)
