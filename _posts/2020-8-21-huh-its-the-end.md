Yeah.

Summer just flew by. I didn't really do anything this week. I didn't accomplish as much as I would have wanted to. This summer was one to remember.

I found passions, and (hopefully) friends. I made a bot [[^1]], spent hours and on discord. I don't know if I should be proud or sad that I spent so much time into making it. My server has grown to 362 members, with one of the first members leaving today. He was a theoretical physics major, and someone I looked up to. He gave good advice, and really helped motivate me through this time. I created a server to pass time during this outbreak. And it helped do that. (I think) the idea came from a server that grew by 600 members in 4 months (cncm).

There I met new people, who were p cool. Actually very cool. Too many OP people to count. I sent 21192 messages in 5 months, which is pretty insane. There, I really learned to enjoy math more. It exposed me to so many op people, and got me back into playing chess. Except i'm still trash so i take it back.

I beat pokemon yellow this summer too, my team consisted of the 3 legendary birds (all of which were at least lv 52), 1 level 45 pikachu, 1 level 35 snorlax, and a level 38 blastoise who knew only one water attack. This was something I dreamt of 2 summers ago. I'm now in the hall of fame, and the game really isn't interesting anymore. I'm going to be using my master ball on a level 5 pidgey so check that out in my yt channel (if I do upload it).

My yt channel [[^2]] is almost at 20k views, which is pretty astounding tbh.

I think staying home all day has been getting to me. I can't run like I used to, my mile time is now like 6:23 or something. I can't do as many pushups, my abs are weak. Tbh i kinda forgot how to play badminton. I can't go there and train anymore. Playing at home against the wall just isn't the same. School starts on monday, we have a totally new schedule. According to the rising 9th graders, the teachers i got were all bad except for my science teacher.

If you're reading this far, idk why you're reading this far. I'm just putting whatever thoughts I have on the internet so yeah. I pretty much procrastinated summer reading, I have 1 book to read. Luckily I don't have to write about that book so that's alright.

I'm going to (try to) make a website for myself @ piboi.github.io so yeah.

I really don't know what to do today, kinda tired, went out to bike this morning.

Anyways, I probably have like 69 grammatical errors in this, I'm too tired to reread it again.
