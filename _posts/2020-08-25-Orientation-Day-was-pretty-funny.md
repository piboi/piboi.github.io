Yeah so basically, we had orientation today.

We were using Microsoft Teams, and the teachers (obviously) had very little understanding as to how it works. We first had a whole middle school meeting thing, and they told us we had to wear our *full* uniforms. This meant socks and shoes too. Most likely, all the asian 5th graders spammed the Q/A questions saying that they couldn't wear shoes inside, and the head of middle school said that we should respect our families so they wouldn't make us wear shoes. He still told us we needed to wear socks inside, but like, how would they check that?

We then headed on to Class Assembly, which is basically where teachers rant about the 3 R's, (respect for teachers, respect for your friends, respect for yourself). While the teacher was talking, he kept unexpectedly getting muted. This went on for like 5 times until the teachers realized we (the students) had the power to mute anyone we wanted. Then the teacher went back to the beginning of his talk about the 3 R's, digital footprints blah blah blah. But it was still pretty funny, (even if it was annoying that we had to sit through his talk again).

After that, we went to Advisory. So this orientation was like going from a big group, to a smaller group, and then to an even smaller group. Anyways, my advisor seems pretty chill, he's an eagle scout and science teacher so that's pretty cool. He's also pretty funny too.

The last thing we went through was "Technology Training". The computer teacher first didn't share the screen and had audio, then shared the screen and had no audio.

That was basically my morning so yeah.
