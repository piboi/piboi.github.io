“Our circadian system is closely tuned to natural as well as artificial light. Light-based alarm clocks can provide a gentle wake signal, to prepare the body for wakefulness.” This quote by Alex Dimitriu, MD (someone you can't possibly know) really does sum up how I think of these alarm clocks.

I've been trying to wake up earlier to get more stuff done, and used to use the sound alarm to wake me up. My dad bought me a light alarm clock, without knowing that it was any different from a normal one.

So I set it up and used it last night, I woke up at like 6:40ish, after setting the light to begin at 6:30. Don't flame me, I wake up pretty late. I felt pretty energized this morning, it was much better than waking up at 7 with a normal alarm. I just laid in bed for about 20 minutes until 6:55 ish.

Overall, the light alarm put me onto a good start to the day (my real last day of summer). It woke me up earlier than with sound alarms so it's a win-win situation. If you want an alarm clock get a light/sound alarm clock, and set a light alarm and a sound alarm, with the sound alarm being 10 to 20 minutes after the light alarm.

This was a low quality post because I've gotta grind summer reading today. This is why you don't neglect summer reading until the last day of summer.

Here's a cliche-ish thing to end this post: The light alarm basically awakened me to the fact that school was starting, meaning that I have summer reading to do
