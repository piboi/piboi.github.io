I realized that if I keep uploading everything from [my blog](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1166939), then I would basically have wayy to many posts.
So from now on, I'll just be posting the posts that I either spent a lot of time on or one that is benificial for the reader. So yeah, that's this post.
