ok.

September is almost over. I have yet to complete any of the goals I set, and hopefully this will be a month of just getting into the swing of things. The grind will become real after tomorrow. I haven't ever punished myself for not finishing a flow everyday, so I will be routinely running more when I haven't felt like I was productive at the end of the day. These days have been mostly filled with watching parts of the Ip Man series, and stuff like that.

Let us define productivity.
pro·duc·tiv·i·ty
/ˌprōˌdəkˈtivədē,ˌprädəkˈtivədē/
the effectiveness of productive effort, especially in industry, as measured in terms of the rate of output per unit of input.


>the effectiveness of productive effort

First point, I haven't put much effort, and it hasn't been very effective.
Effort is something I really need more of. I really just keep getting on tangents by the work of the Instant Gratification Monkey. If you don't know what that is, watch Tim Urban's TED Talk. I've watched it 10ish times, so that is how you know that I'm a professional procrastinator because I keep watching a TED talk about procrastination.

(There really isn't any more points, just need to put more effort shat)


Thank you for reading my rant about not being productive, now it is time for me to run tres mille.
