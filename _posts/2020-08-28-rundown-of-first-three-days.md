Basically school got an hour longer every day so that sucks, they took time out of athletics (which don't exist due to corona) and put it into our schedule. This has its ups and downs.

8th grade > 6th grade > 7th grade > 5th grade in terms of workload.

Most of this time shouldn't have been used and it should've been more like

6th grade > 8th grade > 7th grade > 5th grade,

but i forgot all my Latin from last year and had to take a *ahem* couple *ahem* hours to relearn. I guess (and hope) the workload is gonna be downhill from here?



Microsoft teams is pretty trash, half the time it just freezes. It also drains my battery like it was nothing. On the first day of school, it went from 100 to 12 in 45 minutes.

My wifi was also pretty bad because my parents also use teams so I had like 0.37 mbps download today.

I also set a schedule for myself, setting down the things i wanted to accomplish by the end of next month, so let's hope I can get through that. For example, I can barely run a 623 so im gonna need to fix that.

My discord server is also growing (a little), so that's nice.

Anyways today will be a busy day for me :/ because i accidentally procrastinated oops


Oh also my teacher didn't check our summer reading and had no interest in doing so, so i shouldn't have spent my time reading oops

twas a low qual post because am need to work
