Huh, so first day of school was a bit overwhelming. As it turns out, none of my teachers were much good except my science teacher. Also sad thing was that none of my friends were in my classes, except for like 2 classes.

Anyways, am much tire, so here is a redemption problem


**The Problem**

Find all reals x such that

**Sol**

First of all, notice that x = 2 works. Now it seems that as x increases, the LHS decreases, and the RHS increases. We now prove that.

If we divide by

on both sides, notice that we get:

Now we can clearly see that all the LHS terms are less than one, and the 14/13 term is greater than one. This means that the RHS increases as the LHS decreases, giving us that **2** is our only solution.
