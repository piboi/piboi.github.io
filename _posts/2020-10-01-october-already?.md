Darn.

I have to put 10 instead of 09 now, what? 

Let's hope that September was just a "getting into the swing of things month". Today I checked my flow app thing and I only had 296 hours of productivity since summer. Like what??? Gonna step that up now by blocking Safari when counting hours. Let's hope this works.

School's been fine this month, except the whole homework thing doesn't seem to be helping a lot. I learned the importance of taking good notes because I am 100% history test man for the first time of my life yuhhh. Orchestra is like bleh, the songs aren't that good and so it isn't the best class. Latin is bad D: like how do I know what all these words mean???

I haven't been productive this month oops... The grind gotta become real from now on or else I will be sad :/

(PS: If I don't have 100 productivity hours this month, I'll let ppl choose how far I run? I guess it'll have to be from 1-10 though and I won't tell them that I'm gonna run that many miles, assuming most ppl from cncm don't read my blog)
