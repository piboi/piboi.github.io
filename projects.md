# PoTW Boi, A Discord Bot
I made (and still am updating) a discord bot which you can find on my [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/XHTaYtv). It includes features such as an econonomy, a way to check on the economy, news, a database of math problems, and more.

# BIMO, A Math Olympiad
Along with a few other test writers, we've written the BIMO which is hosted on the [Bruh It's Math Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/XHTaYtv). The contest is close to the difficulty of the APMO (Asian Pacific Math Olympiad). To find out more on how to participate or help with problem writing, join the Bruh It's Math Discord server and ping me (Charge#3766).
